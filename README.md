# Spring Framework Java Back End Application

1. Developed a Spring Framework Java back end for a travel agency web application, leveraging Spring Data JPA, Rest Repositories, MySQL Driver, and Lombok dependencies to ensure efficient data management and seamless RESTful API integration for vacation bookings.
2. Implemented robust packages, including controllers, entities, DAO, and services, to facilitate the seamless operation of a checkout form and vacation packages list, adhering to industry-standard design patterns and best practices.
3. Created a scalable and maintainable codebase, incorporating validation mechanisms to ensure compatibility with the existing Angular front end, enabling smooth communication between the front end and back end while enhancing user experience and minimizing technical debt.
